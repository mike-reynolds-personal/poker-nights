				<p class="lead">Hi {organisername}, you have organised a private poker game of {gametype} at <a href="https://www.pokerroomsnow.com">Poker Rooms Now</a>.</p>
				<p>{hostname} will be hosting the game and the initial buy-in is {buyin} for this {moneytype} money {gameformat} game.</p>
				<p>This is the <a href="{tablelink}">unique game link</a>. If you are also hosting the game, you will need
				   to join the table with the same account which was used to schedule the game ({organiseremail}) in order to start the game-play off.
				   The table is available 15 minutes before the game is scheduled to start, and cannot start before the host joins. The host will 
				   have a couple of additional options to help run the game and <b>{hostwallet}</b> be controlling player wallet allocations as they join the table.</p>
				<p>You have invited {numplayers} players to the game. You can invite more players by forwarding this email, but note that the maximum per 
				   table is {maxplayers}. We suggest you only invite players that you know well and trust to be in your game.</p>
				<p>You have added the following information to the invite:<br>{additionalinfo}</p>
				<p>If you haven't played {gametype} before then you may find some of the resources
				   on the main site useful to get <a href="https://www.pokerroomsnow.com/how-to-play">you prepared</a>.
				   Thank you for organising your game with <a href="https://www.pokerroomsnow.com">Poker Rooms Now</a>!</p>
